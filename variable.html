<!-- Variables are Containers for Storing Data -->
<!-- JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
	Automatically
	Using var
	Using let
	Using const -->

<!-- Note :
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers. -->

<!-- When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be change
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers. -->

<!-- JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
	Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
	Names must begin with a letter.
	Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
	Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
	Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names. -->

<!-- JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
In programming, text values are called text strings.
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string. -->
